# AirGun1D

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating a 1D air gun coupled to an oscillating bubble. The model calculates fields inside the air gun chamber and the acoustic pressure in the water.

This code was used in the paper of Watson, Werpers and Dunham (2018) What controls the initial peak of an air gun source signature? *Geophysics* and this repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the figures in this paper.

### How do I get set up? ###
* Clone this repository to your local directory.
* The 1D air gun code is a finite-difference code that uses summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. In order to run the code you will need to link to also clone the [SBPLib repository](https://bitbucket.org/sbpteam/sbplib) and add that to your MATLAB path.
* Once SBPLib is added to your MATLAB path you should be able to run the code and start generating figures.
* Script files for generating the figures of Watson, Werpers and Dunham (2018) are contained in the MakeFigs directory. This script files should provide guidance for how to run the 1D air gun code.

### Organization of the repository ###
The repository contains several folders:
* MakeFigs - contains the script files for generating each figure.
* SBPSAT - 1D air gun code
* SeismicAirgunCode - lumped parameter model
* Data - data from Lake Seneca field tests. For more details see [Chelminski et al. (2016)](https://www.epmag.com/low-pressure-source-840586#p=full) or [Ronen and Chelminski (2018)](http://earthdoc.eage.org/publication/publicationdetails/?publication=92131).
* BubbleCode - bubble models that are compared between in Appendix 1.

### 1D Air Gun Code ###
The 1D air gun code is contained in the directory SBPSAT. For details on the code please refer to the paper and in particular Appendix B, which describes the numerical scheme. The main function files are:
* runEulerCode.m - loads the discretization of the air gun and bubble properties and then solves the resulting set of ordinary differential equations using ode45
* DiscrAirgun.m - defines the discretization of the air gun. This function applies all of the boundary treatmens and discretization operators. 
* configAirgun.m - air gun, bubble and ambient properties are defined in this file. For example, the ambient density, gas constant and firing duration are defined in this file. Other parameters, like air gun depth and operating pressure, are defined in the script files.
* bubbleRHS.m - describes the bubble governing equations. Parameters unique to the bubble, like the surface magnification factor, are defined here.
